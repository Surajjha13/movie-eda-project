## Movie Dataset EDA

This project is a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a movie dataset.
The goal is to uncover insights about movie production, budget trends, and key statistical distributions using Python and data visualization libraries.

---

### Objectives

* Understand overall data structure and column distribution
* Identify missing values and data quality issues
* Analyze budget, genres, ratings, and revenue trends
* Extract the most repeated or frequent data values
* Visualize key patterns and distributions

---

### Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** ‚Äì for data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** ‚Äì for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì as the interactive environment

---

### Key Steps Performed

* Loaded and cleaned the movie dataset
* Checked data distribution across all columns
* Identified columns with high missing values (e.g., `budget_musd`)
* Extracted most frequently repeated values in categorical columns
* Visualized distributions, counts, and missing data

---

### Noteworthy Observations

* Columns like `budget_musd` have a significant amount of missing values (\~35k)
* The dataset has a rich collection of genres and production years
* Some features need preprocessing for more accurate analysis (e.g., handling nulls, parsing genres)

### Dataset

* Source: [Worldwide Movie Dataset Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajkumarjha1/worldwide-movie-dataset)
* Format: CSV / Structured

---

### How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surajjha13/movie-eda.git
   cd movie-eda
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```
   move eda.ipynb
   ```

---

### Future Improvements

* Handle missing values more deeply (e.g., imputation)
* Add year-wise and genre-wise trend analysis
* Explore relationships between budget, rating, and revenue
* Create interactive dashboards (using Plotly or Streamlit)
